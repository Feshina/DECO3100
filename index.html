            <h3 id="head-car">Cardiovascular Diseases</h3>
            <p>Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally: more people die annually from
                CVDs than from any other cause. An estimated 17.9 million people died from CVDs in 2016, representing
                31% of all global deaths. Of these deaths, 85% are due to heart attack and stroke. Very often, a death
                at old age from a CVD is referred to as a “Natural Death”.</p>

        <div class="explainer-box" id="cancer"><a name="cancer"></a>
            <h3 id="head-can">Cancers</h3>
            <p>Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to
                other parts of the body. These contrast with benign tumors, which do not spread. <br>
                Older people are more susceptible to cancer, as their cells do not grow and replicate as effectively as
                those of a young person. With the increasing life expectancy in the 1st world, more older people develop
                cancers as they live to an older age.</p>

        <div class="explainer-box" id="lrd"><a name="lrd"></a>
            <h3 id="head-lrd">Lower Respiratory Diseases</h3>
            <p>Chronic lower respiratory diseases are a group of conditions affecting the lungs. The group is the second
                leading cause of death in the US and fourth in Australia. The three main contributors to the death rate
                from chronic respiratory diseases are: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma and
                bronchiectasis or permanent damage to the airways. This can be caused by pollution, poor working
                environments and respiratory infections.</p>

        <div class="explainer-box" id="malaria"><a name="malaria"></a>
            <h3 id="head-mal">Malaria</h3>
            <p>Malaria is a serious and sometimes fatal disease caused by a parasite that commonly infects a certain
                type of mosquito which feeds on humans. People who get malaria are typically very sick with high fevers,
                shaking chills, and flu-like illness. <br>
                This illness is common in tropical and equatorial regions of the planet, especially humid tropical
                environments. While a malaria vaccine exists, it’s only effective approximately 40% of the time. African
                countries struggle with this disease as it’s prevalence and poor access to medication can create fatal
                outbreaks in small communities.

            <h3 id="head-hiv">HIV/AIDS</h3>
            <p>Human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is a spectrum
                of conditions caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It attacks the immune
                system, and can disable it altogether, leaving a person with no defences against other diseases. If a
                person is suffering from HIV/AIDS, a simple cold can be fatal. It’s a blood-bourne disease and is spread
                when infected blood makes contact with a mucous membrane. HIV/AIDS is considered a pandemic—a disease
                outbreak which is present over a large area and is actively spreading.

            <h3 id="head-tub">Tuberculosis</h3>
            <p>Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease usually caused by bacteria. Tuberculosis generally affects the
                lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. This disease can be passed on through air, and has
                been present in humans since the ancient times. It’s especially dangerous in countries with poor hygiene
                and healthcare.

        <div class="explainer-box" id="neo"><a name="neo"></a>
            <h3 id="head-neo">Neonatal Disorders</h3>
            <p>Neonatal disorders are disorders or illnesses that occur during prenatal development (in the womb) or in
                the first four weeks of life (neonatal period). Some neonatal disorders are apparent soon after birth,
                while others may develop further in the baby’s life. Some neonatal infections such as HIV, hepatitis B,
                and malaria do not become apparent until much later. Countries with poor healthcare, and those where
                home birth is common, are most susceptible to a high rate of these disorders.</p>

        <div class="explainer-box" id="nat"><a name="nat"></a>
            <h3 id="head-nat">Natural Disasters</h3>
            <p>A natural disaster is a major adverse event resulting from natural processes of the Earth; examples are
                floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis, storms, and other geologic
                processes. These events often leave people without power, homes and clean water.

            <h3 id="head-dia">Diarrheal Disorders</h3>
            <p>Diarrheals disorders refer to watery bowel movements. They are especially dangerous as they cause
                dehydration. In countries where water is not easily available, this can prove fatal, especially when
                combined with another disease.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="explainer-box" id="nut"><a name="nut"></a>
            <h3 id="head-nut">Nutritional Deficiencies</h3>
            <p>A nutritional deficiency occurs when the body doesn't absorb or get from food the necessary amount of a
                nutrient. Deficiencies can lead to a variety of health problems. These can include digestion problems,
                skin disorders, stunted or defective bone growth, and even dementia. In countries with poor economies,
                this is unfortunately a common occurrence. Especially so in children: nutrition is vital for
                development, and if not given proper nutritious food, children will often fail to live into adulthood.

                country.
